## 0.What's this?
The repo is in order to provide a GFWList parser file for your Clash

## 1.Download the file
Just download the `parser.yml` file and open it with your text editor

## 2.Paste your subscription link
Paste your subscription URL after `- url: ` in the `parser.yml`<br>Like this: `- url: https://example.subscription.test/clash?subscription=example`

## 3.Use this file instead of default clash parser
Open your **Clash for Windows** app (it's also available for macOS/Linux, if you don't have one yet, [just download here](https://github.com/Fndroid/clash_for_windows_pkg/releases)), then click **Settings** on the left, and edit **Parser**<br>
Then, delete every character in the file and copy everything in the `parser.yml` into it and save it.

## 4.Update your subscription and check
Then, back to `Profiles` and update your subscription, right click on the profile and click **Rules**, it will work properly if you can see thousands of rules, and please submit an issue if there's any problem with this.
